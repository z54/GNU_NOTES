# 6.1.2 init_config

## Component

**main** consists of DFSG-compliant packages, which do not rely on software outside this area to operate. These are the only packages considered part of the Debian distribution.

**contrib** packages contain DFSG-compliant software, but have dependencies not in main (possibly packaged for Debian in non-free).

**non-free** contains software that does not comply with the DFSG.
